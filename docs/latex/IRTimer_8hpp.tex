\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
All timer specific definitions are contained in this file. Sets IR\+\_\+\+SEND\+\_\+\+PIN if required, e.\+g. if SEND\+\_\+\+PWM\+\_\+\+BY\+\_\+\+TIMER for AVR is defined, which restricts the output to a dedicated pin number. 

timer\+Config\+For\+Send(a\+Frequency\+KHz) must set output pin mode and disable receive interrupt if it uses the same resource
