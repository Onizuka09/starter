# Starter : 

## Description:
**starter**: is a smart automation system designed for publicity stations.

The system ensures seamless startup  of a marketing stand by automating the following processes:

- **TV Control** via IR: Automatically powers on the TV to begin displaying content without user intervention (Remote control).
- **PC Wake-Up** via Ethernet (Wake-on-LAN): Wakes the connected PC to run the publicity application as soon as power is restored.
- **Over the Air updates**: supports OTA via ( Ethernet and WiFi) with the abilty to rollback the update fails. 

---

## Availalable Verisions: 

`version_1`: first version conatins basic fucntionalities (Wol and IR control)

`version_1.1.0`:  we redesigned the IR interface to be universal (supports NEC, SAMSUNG, LG, PulseDistance Protocoles)

`version_1.1.1`:  we intergrate OTA functionalties and redsign of the other modules. we also supports rollback if the updated  firmware is corrupted.

## Architecture & design 


---

## Materials list:

- ESP32 dev module 
- RTC module: DS1302
- SPI Ethernet module: W3300
- RGB LED 
- Button  
- IR reciever and emitter 

---

## Project structure 
**- Include Folder**: 
- conf.h : contains build flags that are use at compile time to enable & dispable certain modules <br>
- Hadrware.h: contains Pins defetions   <br>
- ButtonModule.h : provides APIs to control button  <br> 
- IR_Module.h : provides APis to control IR send and Receive <br>
- Mylog.h: interface for intituitive logging functionalities <br>
- mystorage.h: provides APIs to controll Little FS ( strorage system) <br>
- network_stack.h : provides APIs for network functionalities. <br>
- RGBModule.h : provides APIs functionalities to control RGB<br>
- RTC_module.h: provides APIs functionalities to control RTC <br>
- soft_version.h : macro that contains the firmware version<br>

**- Src Folder**: 

- this folder contains the main Fimware :`main.cpp` <br>
- It also conatains the implemntation of the Other modules. <br> 
- The WoL_Task is the implementation of the Wake On Lan task. <br>

**- Test Folder**: 

- Contains the testing firmwares for modules

**- data Folder**: 

- Contains json settings file that will be uploaded to the ESP32 board. 

**- Makefile**: 

- contains rules to automate the process of building and flashing the project. 

**- Scripts**: 

A folder that cotains python scripts that platformio uses it,

we have a script to that instructs pio at build time to append the `version` at the end of the build output:  `firmware_1.1.0.bin`

## Usage 
- clone the repo 
- install the dependencies 
- build the project 

---

## Contribution rules: 
To add a new feature you must follow these steps: 

create a new branch withe the feature name  
if the feature is new module implementation: ( new sensor): 
- you must follow this structure 
 ```
include:
----- module_name.h 
src: 
----- module_name.cpp 
 ```

> **Note For testing** 

To test the module or the feature 

create a new file in the src file called `test_module_name.cpp`  in platformio.ini  

 ```pio
build_src_filter= +<test_module_name.cpp.cpp>   
 ```
after testing you can move the test file in the test folder in comment out the build src flag in the platformio.ini then you can merge. 


> **Note For commits**
